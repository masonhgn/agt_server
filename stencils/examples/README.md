# Example Solutions

This directory contains example solutions for each lab. These solutions demonstrate working implementations of the algorithms and strategies taught in each lab.

## Structure

- `lab01/` - Rock Paper Scissors (Fictitious Play, Exponential Weights)
- `lab02/` - Battle of the Sexes (Finite State Machine, BOSII Competition)
- `lab03/` - Chicken Game (Q-Learning, Collusion Environment)
- `lab04/` - Lemonade Stand (Non-RL and RL agents)
- `lab06/` - Auction (Marginal Value, Local Bidding)
- `lab07/` - Advanced Auction (SCPP, Histogram methods)
- `lab08/` - Ad Exchange One Day (Bidding strategies)
- `lab09/` - Ad Exchange Two Day (Multi-day bidding strategies)

## Usage

These example solutions can be used for:
- Testing the server infrastructure
- Integration testing
- Reference implementations for students
- Automated testing of lab functionality

Each solution file contains working implementations that can be run directly or imported for testing purposes.
