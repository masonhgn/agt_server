# Execution Flow

## Game Session Sequence

The typical flow of a game session:

### Initial Setup
```
Client → Server: Connect
Server → Client: Confirm connection
Client → Server: Join game
Server → Engine: Create game
Engine → Game: Initialize
Game → Engine: Initial state
Engine → Client: Game ready
```

### Game Rounds (Repeated)
```
Engine → Client: Send observation
Client → Agent: Get action
Agent → Client: Return action
Client → Engine: Send action
Engine → Game: Step game
Game → Engine: New state
Engine → Client: Send results
```

### Game Completion
```
Engine → Server: Game complete
Server → Client: Final results
```

## Tournament Management

How tournaments are managed:

```
Start Tournament → Match Players → Run Games → Collect Results → More Matches?
                                                                    ↓
                                                              Yes → (loop)
                                                                    ↓
                                                              No → Calculate Rankings → Save Results
```

## Game Round Flow

Detailed flow of a single game round:

```
Round Start → Send Observations → Collect Actions → Process Game Logic → Calculate Rewards → Update Agents → Game Done?
                                                                                                                      ↓
                                                                                                                No → (loop)
                                                                                                                      ↓
                                                                                                                Yes → End Game
```

## Error Handling

How the system handles various error conditions:

```
Error Occurs → Error Type?
                    ↓
              Timeout → Use Default Action → Continue Game → Log Error
                    ↓
              Invalid Action → Reject Action → Request New Action → Log Error
                    ↓
              Connection Lost → Disconnect Player → Notify Other Players → Log Error
                    ↓
              Game Error → End Game Early → Save Partial Results → Log Error
```

## Performance Monitoring

Metrics collection during execution:

```
Game Execution → Collect Metrics
                      ↓
              ├── Response Times
              ├── Action Frequencies
              ├── Reward Distributions
              └── Error Rates
                      ↓
              Performance Analysis → Generate Reports → Save to Results
```

## Communication Protocol

Message flow between client and server:

```
Client → Server: Join Game
Server → Client: Game Ready
Client → Server: Get Action
Server → Client: Observation
Client → Server: Action
Server → Client: Results
Client → Server: Ready Next
Server → Client: Next Round
```

## Message Types

| Message Type | Direction | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Join Game | Client → Server | Request to join a game |
| Game Ready | Server → Client | Confirm game is ready |
| Get Action | Server → Client | Request action from agent |
| Action | Client → Server | Send chosen action |
| Results | Server → Client | Send game results |
| Ready Next | Client → Server | Ready for next round |
