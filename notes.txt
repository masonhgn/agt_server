1. add running log to lemonade server (15min)
2. create test lemonade agent that uses pytorch and/or other libraries (1hr)
3. add arnie's lab (2.5hr) (copy arnies code into a new example agent for lemonade game)






4. rename spacial game (2min)
- rename to lemonade game

5. fix leaderboard on short-form labs dashboard, make leaderboard return to every agent (45min)
- leaderboard should display all students
- leaderboard should be sent out to all students via server connection

6. figure out separation between student version of repo and TA access repo (15min)
- what code should not be visible to students?
- how can we separate that code in a clean, maintainable and intuitive way?

7. figure out separate ip connections (1hr)
- currently, the labs allow localhost connections only. we need to make sure that if we run the server on an open port, we
 can connect to it with agents from other ips.
